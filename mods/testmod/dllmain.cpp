// These two lines are mandatory for sc2kfix mods. The first one ensures that all Windows API
// calls use the ANSI calls instead of the Unicode calls, which aligns with the way that SimCity
// 2000 was compiled. It should be the first preprocessor line of each source file in each mod.
// The second is required in **EXACTLY** one file of each mod and no more, and lets sc2k_1996.h
// define all of its GAMECALLs and GAMEOFFs so the mod can interact with the game engine in the
// same way that the sc2kfix core does.
#undef UNICODE
#define GAMEOFF_IMPL

// Include files go here. The standard order used in the sc2kfix project is to have bracketed C
// header files first, then any bracketed C++ header files, and then quoted header files.
#include <windows.h>
#include "../sc2kfix.h"

// The stModHooks array of structs define each hook that the mod exports. Each hook is defined
// with a string of its full name followed by a signed integer of its priority level. Lower
// priorities are called first, so eg. a mod that exports Hook_OnNewCity_After with a priority
// of 0 will be called after a mod that exports Hook_OnNewCity_After with a priority of -1 and
// before a mod that exports Hook_OnNewCity_After with a priority of 1.

// The stModInfo structure tells the sc2kfix mod loader about the mod and how to load it. It
// contains the version info for the mod itself as well as what version of sc2kfix it requires, as
// well as some basic textual descriptions of the mod and info about the stModHooks struct so that
// sc2kfix can load the mod's exported hooks.

// stModInfo should always be named exactly that; various macros depend on the stModInfo structure
// and renaming it will cause widespread compilation errors.

// conventions of the Windows API documentation for DLL entry points, as the DllMain function

// Both the 'Hook_SimulationProcessTickDaySwitch_Before' and

// The equivalent mod hook is not present due to this change.

// All game hooks exported from mods are declared using the HOOKCB macro, which expands to
// extern "C" __declspec(dllexport). This makes sure that there's no C++ name mangling and imports
// on the sc2kfix side are similarly simple.
//
// This is a "before" hook, and is called when sc2kfix intercepts a part of SimCity 2000's game
// engine, and before it lets the engine (or, depending on the hook, a recreation thereof) execute
// its original code. Many "before" hooks have a corresponding "after" hook that runs after the
// engine completes its designated task that the hook is related to, but before the calling
// function in the engine is returned to.

// GameDoIdleUpkeep function).
